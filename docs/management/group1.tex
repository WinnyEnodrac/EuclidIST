\subsection{Boltzmann codes}
This section includes an overview of publicly available Boltzmann codes. For each code we present a schema in the same format, including pros and cons.

\subsubsection{Requirements to trust a code in Modified Gravity}

For every MG model, there should be at least 2 Boltzmann codes, agreeing. Agreement is defined as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
 \item check them on LCDM, need to agree at less than 0.1\%
 \item check them in a MG scenario in different ranges of parameters: they should match at the same level at which they agree in LCDM on 
all background quantities, all perturbation quantities, all spectra
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsubsection{CAMB}
%\href{http://camb.info/}{CAMB}
(\url{http://camb.info/})\\

{\it \bf Language:} fortran90\\

\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Cons:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item structure of the code requires to modify different parts of the code for different models
 \item no general distribution function for neutrinos

 \item maintainer (Antony Lewis) not currently in Euclid
\end{itemize}

\newpage
\subsubsection{EFTCAMB}
(\url{http://wwwhome.lorentz.leidenuniv.nl/~hu/codes/})\\

{\it \bf Language:} fortran90\\

{\it \bf Includes:}\\

{\it \bf Pros:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item based on CAMB
 \item very general parametrization for effective field theory (EFT) parametrisation of MG and DE models
 \item tested against HiCLASS/MGCAMB/private codes for some models
 \item several parameterisations of the background expansion and also of the perturbations (now including the Horndeski functions)
 \item perturbation evolution computed self-consistently for EFT class of models

\newpage
\subsubsection{MGCAMB}(\url{http://aliojjati.github.io/MGCAMB/})\\

{\it \bf Language:} fortran90\\

{\it \bf Includes: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item changes the response of the scalar metric potentials (phi and psi) to the perturbations: this can be due to modifications of the Einstein equations 
 (modified gravity) or due to extra clustering components (dark energy)
\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Pros: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item it works with some well tested parametrization; easy to compare with previous results 
 \item can test  very general deviations from LCDM visible in the scalar metric perturbations
\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Cons: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item When used as a ‘EFT replacement’:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item does not evolve all perturbation equations 
  \item assumes quasi static limit
 \end{itemize}
 \item General deviations in scalar metric perturbations require careful parameterisation, some further developments (eg. Gaussian process) may be required
 \item Does not include similar deviations in vector and tensor perturbations
 \item Works with $\Lambda$CDM background
\end{itemize}
Warning: the code was recently updated (late february). These comments do not refer to the latest version.\\

 \item maintainer (Julien Lesgourgues) is active Euclid member
\end{itemize}

{\it \bf Cons: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item community that uses/tested CLASS is smaller than CAMB
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Parameter estimation codes}

\subsubsection{Requirements for parameter estimation codes}

The basic requirement for codes which obtain cosmological predictions from Boltzmann codes and perform parameter estimation is ``modularity''.\\
A modular code is easy to modify in case some changes and updates need to be included, e.g. additional likelihoods, extra parameters, correction to observables (systematics).\\
Furthermore, separate modules for different physical quantities are needed for the atomistic approach as they allow to easily retrieve and compute the intermediate quantities of the theory
flows (see e.g. Fig. \ref{WLtomo}) and to compare them between different codes.\\
However too much modularity may affect code performances.\\

A wishlist of module is:
\begin{enumerate}
 \item module calling the Boltzmann/transfer function codes for primary science
 \item module calling the sampler
 \item module for each likelihood for each probe
 \item module for background quantities
 \item module for perturbation quantities
 \item module for non-linear corrections (ex. halofit)
 \item module that gets the standard output from Boltzmann codes and produces list of suitable output
 \item postprocessing of the samples
 \item plotting modules 
\end{enumerate}

In the following, the publicly available codes are listed, together with the requirements which are satisfied by each of them. The missed requirements are also listed and the complexity 
of implementation is indicated as easy (E), medium (M) and difficult (D)

\subsubsection{Overview of publicly available codes}

\paragraph{COSMOMC}(\url{http://cosmologist.info/cosmomc/})\\
{\it Language:} fortran90\\
{\it pros:}
\begin{itemize}
 \item updated constantly
 \item very well tested, very efficient for standard cosmology
 \item used by a large community
 \item easy to add parameters
 \item easy to add an additional likelihood by adding a separate module
 \item nice python graphical interactive interface for first tests

 \item Updated to all currently available data (WL, GC, clusters, CMB).
 \item Likelihood Sampler works really well
\end{itemize}
{\it Cons: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item if you increase the number of parameters, the sampler gets slower. Other samplers are publicly available and already interfaced with COSMOMC. However they are not included in the 
 standard version (interface needs to be modified when COSMOMC is updated)

\end{itemize}
{\it Wish-list requirements: }
\begin{itemize}
 \item included: 1, 2 (add samplers), 3, 6, 8, 9

\subsection{Code recommendation}

\paragraph{Coding Language}
The SGS use python and C++ only, and it would be good for us to follow them to have some coherence. Although there are pros and cons.\\
It would be ideal to have a python infrastructure: wrappers in python to other codes written in different open sources free languages (instead of IDL, Mathematica)\\
FR software to convert languages from one to another: help to write a python wrapper, for example SDC is using swig (http://www.swig.org/).
Good experience with SWIG, it serves as a way of passing data between python and other languages (Bjoern: tried out python$\rightarrow$C with openMP-parallelisation)\\
Make sure all libraries used/needed are available. 
SDC already has a list of libraries that are allowed to be used, at \url{http://euclid.roe.ac.uk/projects/codeen-users/wiki/EDEN}.
Python slow for high level performances, 

%\paragraph{Infrastructure}

\paragraph{Boltzmann code}

No specific choice, but recommendation is that we need at least 2 codes that match for each model (match in the sense explained above); 
in addition, our recommendation is to use MGCAMB only for tests (and clearly specify limitations of the code and assumptions in it)


\paragraph{Parameter estimation}
MontePython at present is the one that includes the highest number of requirements in the wish list. JL \& team within Euclid guarantee fast 
update for wrappers to Boltzmann code version updates and to new data which become available. 

\paragraph{Analysis and visualization}
Getdist and plotting tools provided by cosmomc

\paragraph{Code testing}
Self-consistent check of the likelihood codes:  use a simulation to produce a set of data and check if we can recover the initial cosmological model.\\
Available simulations: \\
galaxy mock catalogue
\begin{enumerate}
 \item from MICE simulations (HOD) in LCDM cosmology  \url{http://internal.euclid-ec.org/?page_id=1551}
 \item from Durham simulations (SAM) in LCDM cosmology 
\end{enumerate}
Needed:
\begin{itemize}
 \item simulations from non-standard cosmological models: e.g. f(R), DE 
 \item mock catalogue for WL (to be asked to the WL splinter-2
\end{itemize}


\paragraph{Required output from other groups}
\begin{itemize}
 \item SDC: list of python libraries (\url{http://euclid.roe.ac.uk/projects/codeen-users/wiki/EDEN})
 \item TWG:
 \begin{itemize}
  \item parameter definition document
  \item list of Boltzmann codes available for MG
 \end{itemize}
 \item Simulations: list of simulations available
\end{itemize}
